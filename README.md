Grame
=====

An easy to use, lightweight 2D grid based game engine!

You can download it from [here](https://github.com/moomoohk/New-Grame/raw/master/Build/Grame.jar).

(I'm still working on the JavaDocs)

You can find a demo video I made [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGAz6txCHZM) and other Grame related videos on my [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/user/moomoohk).
